## Aim of the Project
 I have developed this project "Popcorn" so that every people can book their movie ticket from their home or any place without standing in a line.

 
## Background

Alltime movie is the source of the entertainment. There is no people who like to see movie. Every people want to see movie in the hall. But in our country , it is a major problem that people buy ticket going to the hall by standing in a line and waiting about more then 2-3 hours. It is very difficult. All cinema hall in our country except Cineplex use this old method.This is why people are afraid to go to the hall to see movie. To remove this difficulties, sufferings and modern touch to the cinema hall I have developed online movie ticket booking system named "Popcorn".

## Expected Output
1. Everyone can see the running movie name all halls in the bangladesh.

4. You can review movie and hall.
5. Manager of the specific hall can add movie, movie trailer and update hall information.
